	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Not Every Big Reptile Was A Dinosaur</h1>
	
	<p>Out of the three mentioned, only stegosauruses are dinosaurs. Plesiosaurs and pterosaurs are both just large reptiles. 
	This is primarily because dinosaurs were terrestrial (land dwelling) animals; plesiosaurs were aquatic, and 
	pterosaurs spent a lot of their time in the skies, sometimes over the ocean. Additionally, dinosaurs have a distinctive 
	way of standing (with their legs beneath them, similar to how dogs stand) that sets them apart from other reptiles 
	(e.g. crocodiles have their legs at their sides). Plesiosaurs don't even have legs, and pterosaurs had their own 
	unique way of walking. Due to the change in sea levels over time, the fossil record has some gaps in it, so it's 
	unknown exactly how the animals evolved. However, it is known that plesiosaurs and pterosaurs evolved during the same 
	time period as the dinosaurs, most likely diverging from the same common ancestor, and pterosaurs were most likely 
	the reptile that was most closely related to the dinosaurs.
	</p>
	
	<p>Technically there are two types of plesiosaurs: pilosauromorphs (which had short necks) and plesiosauromorphs 
	(which had long necks, the ones most people think of when hearing plesiosaur); the longest plesiosauromorph neck was 
	22 feet/7 metres long. Both types could grow as big as dinosaurs, with larger ones being around the size of tour buses, 
	while smaller ones were only car-sized. But contrary to popular depictions, plesiosauromorphs' necks weren't twisty and snake-like. 
	Due to the many muscles and thick bones in their necks (required to support its length and weight), their necks were fairly 
	stiff and remained facing straight forwards. This was also necessary for swimming, as if the neck wasn't stiff, the water's 
	currents would've pushed against it and disrupted the reptile's balance and movement.

	<p>It's unknown exactly why plesiosauromorphs had such long necks, but they were likely ambush predators and long distance 
	swimmers, so their necks could've helped them reduce water resistance when they swam, as well as allowed them to watch prey 
	while hiding their body. Pilosauromorphs were likely pursuit predators, and more agile than plesiosauromorphs, but both were 
	the apex predators of the ocean. Both had similar diets, being opportunists who ate ammonites, crustaceans, mollusks, sharks, 
	other animals' eggs, baby pterosaurs, and possibly even each other. Of course, larger plesiosaurs tended to eat larger prey.
	</p>
	
	<p>Despite being marine animals, plesiosaurs didn't have gills, and needed to periodically resurface in order to get air. 
	But they were still well adapted for water, having the ability to hear and smell underwater, as well as vision adapted for the 
	dark depths. Unlike most reptiles, plesiosaurs gave birth to live babies (i.e. got pregnant), around 1-3 at a time. This is 
	likely because dragging their large bodies onto land to lay eggs was too impractical. Plesiosaurs evolved into their well-known 
	forms shortly before the Jurassic, and went extinct in the subsequent Cretaceous period, along with the dinosaurs.
	</p>
	
	<p>As for pterosaurs, there are too many different types of them to mention, with pterodactyls being by far the most well known 
	due to being the first pterosaur to be discovered; like plesiosaurs, pterosaurs evolved during the Triassic and lived until the 
	Cretaceous extinction. With how many different types there were, they varied a lot in size; the very earliest ones were 
	tree-dwellers the size of robins (pterodactyls were around the size of ducks), while some pterosaurs during the Cretaceous 
	were a metre or two taller than giraffes, with wingspans of the same length. During the Jurassic, the largest pterosaur species 
	was in-between the two extremes, with a size and wingspan comparable to an albatross (which has the largest wingspan of any 
	extant bird). As with plesiosaurs, it's unknown how exactly pterosaurs evolved, including how they evolved to gain flight.

	<p>Pterosaurs were the first non-insects to gain flight, through adaptations such as hollow bones (like birds) and 
	skin-like wings fused with their hands (like bats). Despite this, they were perfectly capable of walking as well as flying, 
	as unlike bats, they still had fingers that weren't fused with their wings. All pterosaurs were carnivores and used their 
	flight to their full advantage, actively searching for their prey, but their exact diet varied based on their species and niche. 
	Some hunted terrestrially, and preyed upon lizards, insects, eggs, baby dinosaurs, and/or dinosaur carcasses. 
	Others searched for prey in the ocean, eating fish and mollusks and crustaceans. These pterosaurs could likely float like ducks, 
	entering the water when they found prey, and eating it (similar to a stork or pelican) before taking off back into the skies. 
	As a result, some species of pterosaur had big throat pouches like pelicans, and others had mouths full of needle-like teeth, 
	though they all had elongated necks and beak-like snouts.

	<p>It's completely unknown how pterosaurs flew, especially the larger ones, but despite their size, the larger pterosaurs 
	are estimated to have reached speeds of 50-70 mph, comparable to the speed of a hummingbird. However, their reproduction 
	is known to be similar to that of other reptiles, laying soft-shelled eggs and burying them in the dirt to keep them safe 
	while they incubated.
