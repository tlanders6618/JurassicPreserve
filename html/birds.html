	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Birds</h1>
	
	<p>The creature here is an <em>Archaeopteryx</em>, a transitional species between dinosaurs and birds that lived during the Late Jurassic. 
	It had features of both, to the point where scientists don't agree on whether it's a reptilian bird, or an avian reptile. 
	It's the closest thing the Jurassic period had to a bird, as birds didn't exist yet. 
	Birds didn't speciate from the other dinosaurs until after the Jurassic period ended, 
	though some dinosaurs&mdash;such as the <em>Archaeopteryx</em>&mdash;started gaining bird-like traits before then. 
	These traits likely helped them adapt to niches that the other dinosaurs didn't fill 
	(as other dinosaurs were much larger than birds). 
	</p>
	
	
	<p>When the other dinosaurs went extinct from an asteroid hitting Earth, only the avian dinosaurs were able to survive by 
	speciating into birds. Selective pressure gave them more feathers to protect them from the months-long winter&mdash;caused by 
	dust clouds from the asteroid blocking the sun&mdash;and beaks to eat buried seeds, since most other food sources had perished. 
	In the subsequent Palocene period that began when the Earth recovered from the asteroid hit, the dino-birds radiated into 
	many different bird species to fill the open niches that the dead dinosaurs left behind. 
	They also gained smaller and lighter forms to fly even better, 
	likely to reach the fruits and flowers that were now growing on trees.
	</p>
	
	<p>In addition to their un-birdlike teeth, <em>Archaeopteryxes</em> had claws for feet, not talons, and had 
	three shortened claws in each of their wings, somewhat similar to bats. Though their exact diet is unknown, 
	<em>Archaeopteryxes</em> were definitely carnivores, possibly eating insects, small reptiles, and/or mammals 
	(all mammals during the Jurassic period were small, as bigger ones had not evolved yet); 
	they likely used their wing claws to seize prey, since they didn't have beaks.
	</p>
	
	<p>It's unknown if <em>Archaeopteryxes</em> lived on the ground, in trees, or moved between both, though their claw structure doesn't 
	appear to be built for perching on trees. It's also unknown if they possessed true flight, or only used their wings to glide, 
	but it's possible that they had flight similar to chickens, only activating it in short bursts to escape danger. 
	The only thing known for certain is that their feathers were either black, or had black tips. 
	Interestingly, fossils of <em>Archaeopteryxes</em> don't have any feathers or their neck or head, only on their tails and wings; 
	it's unknown if this is a side effect of the way they were fossilised, or if <em>Archaeopteryxes</em> simply didn't have any there.
