	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Dilophosaurus</h1>
	
	<p>First of all, dilophosauruses didn't have neck frills and couldn't spit venom. They were better identified by the two bony 
	crests on their head (whose purpose was unknown, but possibly used for mating). They were pretty light for a dinosaur, 
	weighing in the hundreds of pounds instead of thousands; combined with their long legs and tail (used for balance when running), 
	they were fast pursuit predators. Their mouths had two types of teeth: long and curved in the front and short and serrated in 
	the back. The long teeth were for holding onto prey, and the short teeth were for tearing apart flesh, both living and dead 
	(dilophosauruses, like most carnivorous dinosaurs, weren't above scavenging) . Dilophosauruses were thought to have primarily 
	hunted smaller dinosaurs as prey.
	</p>
	
	<p>The reason acting aggressive against the dilophosaurus worked was because there wasn't a more realistic way to deal with it. 
	Extant wild carnivores are much less likely to attack humans who appear bigger or talk, and much more likely to attack humans who 
	turn and run (which makes predators view them as prey and triggers their instincts to give chase). Although real dilophosauruses 
	probably wouldn't be as cautious around humans (especially not if they're hungry), it's possible that one that's been around 
	humans its whole life (like the one in the story) might learn to be similarly cautious. In contrast, playing dead and 
	trying to run would both certainly be bad ideas against a carrion eating pursuit predator, especially one that's hungry.
