	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Climate</h1>
	
	<p>During the Jurassic period, the entire planet (including the ocean) was anywhere from 5-10 degrees Celsius 
	(9-18 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than it is today. This is because Earth (and its continents) is made up of tectonic plates, 
	which are constantly in motion, and have been ever since they were formed. Though they only move an average of 3 centimeters 
	(1 inch) per year, this has led to drastic changes in Earth's geography over the several billion years it's been in existence. 
	</p>
	
	<p>By the time of the Triassic period, all of Earth's continents had long since drifted together to form a single supercontinent, 
	called Pangaea. But following the same endless tectonic cycle as the supercontinent Rodinia before it, Pangaea was already 
	breaking up. The process was very slow, taking tens of millions of years. By the end of the Triassic (start of the Jurassic), 
	fissures had formed in the Earth due to Pangaea's split, allowing magma from inside the Earth to spew out, causing 
	widespread volcanic eruptions. These eruptions unleashed massive amounts of carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere, and caused a 
	mass extinction that ended the Triassic. (After the initial split finished, the fissures healed and the eruptions stopped).

	<p>Even though the ash eventually cleared, the carbon dioxide still remained. The average concentration of carbon dioxide in the 
	atmosphere now (at least in America) is no more than 1,000 ppm (parts per million), but during the Jurassic, it was about 5 times 
	higher, around 5,000-6,000 ppm. Because carbon dioxide traps heat from the Sun, temperatures on Earth rose, leading to the warm 
	climate of the Jurassic. However, the air would still have been breathable by humans, as no concentration under 10,000 ppm 
	causes any health issues.
	</p>
	
	<p>During the Jurassic, Pangaea continued drifting apart, splitting into two giant continents: 
	Laurasia (Northern Pangaea, which would later split into modern day North America, Europe, and Asia) and Gondwana 
	(Southern Pangaea, which would later split into modern day South America, Africa, Antarctica, and Australia). Once complete, 
	this split would also create the Atlantic Ocean, though the modern continents would not appear until the end of the 
	Jurassic/start of the Cretaceous.

	<p>As a result of the warm temperatures, the atmosphere was more humid, and no polar ice caps (or glaciers) existed. 
	Snow was likely possible during the winter, but would have melted fairly quickly. Similar to today, there were large desert 
	regions on either side of the equator, while the equatorial region was still rainforest-like. But unlike today, the rest of the 
	world was also forest-like, including the poles. In the Jurassic, it rained more often than it does today, due to the increased 
	heat evaporating water faster. This supported plant growth everywhere except around the equator 
	(due to rainfall in those regions mainly being focused on the equator itself, due to something called the 
	Intertropical Convergence Zone, where there are strong atmospheric winds that affect the rain), thus leading to deserts forming there. 
	</p>
	
	<p>The deserts experienced wet and dry seasons, just like they do today, and the forests likely experienced normal seasons 
	(though since almost all Jurassic plants were evergreen and there were no flowers, both spring and autumn would've looked very 
	different from today). However, the forests at the poles would've been different. Due to the way the Earth is tilted and rotates, 
	the poles only have two seasons: summer, also called polar day (when the pole is facing towards the Sun and receives constant 
	light) and winter, also called polar night (when the pole is facing away from the Sun and receives constant darkness); this is 
	also true for today. One pole is always facing towards the Sun, and the other is always facing away from it, since they're on 
	opposite ends of the Earth; they rotate roughly every 6 months. As a result, the Jurassic forests near the poles would've 
	alternated between months long summers where it was always daytime, and months long winters where it was always nighttime.
