	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Animals</h1>
	
	<p>The Mesozoic Era (encapsulating the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods, respectively) is known as the "Age of Dinosaurs" 
	for good reason, as dinosaurs were the dominant life form on Earth for the almost 200 million years it lasted. 
	Non-dinosaur fauna weren't as prominent, but despite the odd features that some of them had, most of them were 
	actually very similar to their extant counterparts.</p> 

	<p>For example, crocodiles have remained practically unchanged in the millions of years, with nostrils on top of their snouts 
	that let them breathe while they hid their bodies below the water's surface and laid in wait for prey. 
	Their adaptations&mdash;including cold-bloodedness that allowed them to thrive in the Jurassic's warm climate&mdash;were so useful and 
	efficient that they've barely evolved since, even outlasting the dinosaurs. 
	Despite changes to bone structure since the Jurassic, frogs, snakes, geckos, and turtles were also around, 
	and were also easily recognisable as such, being visually similar to their modern counterparts. 
	They played similar roles in the Jurassic ecosystem as well, with some Jurassic crocodiles having jaws strong enough to 
	tear through a turtle's shell and easily eat its prey.</p>

	<p>The oceans contained nautiluses&mdash;mollusks with many little tentacles that lived in spiral shells&mdash;and ammonites, 
	which look similar to nautiluses but likely had eight arms instead of a mass of tentacles. 
	They swam among coral, crabs, lobsters, and of course, fish. 
	However, not all the lobsters had incredibly long antennae, just the (now extinct) genus <em>Palinurina</em>. 
	While nautiluses and ammonites ate crabs and fish, squids and octopuses ate them, including the <em>Passaloteuthis laevigata</em>, 
	an extinct cephalopod that was related to squids. Instead of suckers, each of its arms had two rows of little hooks 
	(roughly 40 per arm), which it used to grip its prey. The males also seemed to have a pair of extra large hooks, 
	possibly used for mating. But even the <em>Passaloteuthis laevigata</em> was prey for the sharks that existed during the Jurassic. 
	Although sharks existed long before the Jurassic, 
	Jurassic sharks were the first common ancestors of modern sharks, and were similar to their descendants.</p>

	<p>The animals that were most different in the Jurassic were mammals. "Proto-mammals" with a mix of reptilian and 
	mammalian traits existed before the Jurassic, but when the fully reptilian dinosaurs evolved, the proto-mammals were 
	either outcompeted into extinction, or speciated by gaining more mammal-like traits. These mammaliaformes were 
	either primarily or exclusively nocturnal, in order to avoid competition with dinosaurs. As a result, they were all small 
	(around the size of squirrels) and mainly ate insects, which they didn't have to compete with dinosaurs over. 
	The flying squirrel-like <em>volaticotherium</em> is the perfect example of this, having evolved to live in trees away from the carnivorous 
	dinosaurs that would've loved to eat them.</p>

	<p>However, the insects the mammaliaformes ate weren't that different from modern insects. 
	A hundred million years before the Jurassic, Earth had high oxygen levels due to its rampant plant growth. 
	Because insects are too small to have lungs, they breathe through holes in their skin, using passive diffusion to
	gain oxygen, and tubes called tracheae carry the oxygen through their bodies.
	The excess oxygen during that time let the insects evolve much smaller tracheae, which freed up energy and tissue costs, 
	allowing some to grow as big as small dogs. But after the time period ended due to a mass extinction, oxygen levels dropped; 
	by the time of the Jurassic, Earth's oxygen levels were only a little bit higher than the present day. 
	Due to their lack of lungs, insects could no longer carry oxygen through such large bodies, so they
	evolved to have bigger tracheas and shrunk in size, appearing roughly the same as they do today. 
	By the time of the Jurassic, familiar pests like cockroaches and termites already existed, alongside dragonflies and damselflies. 
	Additionally, the first wasps, ants, and beetles started appearing, all serving as prey for reptiles and mammals.</p>
