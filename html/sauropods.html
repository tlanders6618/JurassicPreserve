	<p>Four members of the Macronaria clade of sauropods. The brown one is a Camarasaurus, the grey one is a Brachiosaurus, 
	the orangeish one is a Giraffatitan, and the green one is a Euhelopus. For reference, Brachiosauruses were about as tall as four
	storey buildings. Aside from the Euhelopus (from the Cretaceous), all of them lived during the Jurassic period.
