	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Stegosaurus</h1>
	
	<p>Everyone knows the stegosaurus (which only existed for a few million years during the late Jurassic) for the distinctive 
	twin rows of bone-like plates running down its back, but no one knows what those plates were actually for. It's known that their 
	plates had blood vessels in them, so there are several competing theories for their purpose. The plates might have gathered blood 
	to cool it down and redistribute it through the stegosaurus's body, become engorged with blood to make the plates bigger as a 
	form of threat display (as featured in the game), or the blood flow could've simply been there to promote the plates' growth. 
	Regardless, the plates likely served as a form of intimidation to predators.
	</p>
	
	<p>This was likely necessary because stegosauruses were slow and couldn't run very fast (or at all), not necessarily because of 
	their size, but because their hind legs were longer than their front legs. But intimidation wasn't always enough, especially 
	since allosauruses (stegosauruses' main predator) were equally as big as them, which is why stegosauruses also had thagomizers 
	(i.e. spiked tails; named from a joke in the comic strip <em>The Far Side</em>). Thagomizers had sharp spikes up to 4 feet long,  
	and stegosauruses could swing them hard enough to kill. Based on fossils, around 10% of stegosauruses had used their thagomizers 
	enough to cause damage to their tips, and several allosauruses had died from puncture wounds made by thagomizers 
	(including one allosaurus that suffered a fatal blow to its crotch).
	</p>
	
	<p>Like many extant large herbivores (e.g. rhinos), stegosauruses likely lived and travelled in herds. 
	They also had relatively short necks (preventing them from reaching trees), so they ate by grazing from plants that grew 
	close to the ground (cycads and ferns). They had beak-like mouths, small teeth, and weak jaws, making their bite force pretty 
	weak for their size, similar to that of a sheep (which is weaker than a human).
