	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Extinction</h1>
	
	<p>The Mesozoic era (and its Age of Dinosaurs/Reptiles) ended when an asteroid hit the Earth. Its size and force of impact created 
	a huge blast that caused earthquakes, tidal waves, and forest fires around the world. The rock that was vaporised from the 
	explosion made a worldwide dust cloud that took months to dissipate, blocking the Sun all the while. The subsequent dark winter 
	killed most plants, which caused most herbivores to starve, which caused most carnivores to starve. 
	In total, 75% of all life was dead by the time it was all over. Practically all larger animals (mainly the dinosaurs) went 
	extinct, because they needed to eat large amounts of food to survive.
	</p>
	
	<p>Nautiluses lived at the bottom of the sea. They were already used to not getting much sunlight, and were minimally impacted 
	by the tidal waves, able to survive by eating other surviving bottom-dwellers like crustaceans. Many of the smaller sharks were 
	able to survive by doing the same, their flexible diets allowing them to easily eat nautiluses and whatever else they could find. 
	Animals that lived in or near a river (e.g. amphibians) also had the advantage of dead plant and animal matter being swept into 
	rivers and being carried downstream, supplying them with some amount of free food to scavenge.
	</p>
	
	<p>Crocodiles breathe slowly, have a slow heartbeat, and spend a lot of time remaining still. As a result, they could conserve 
	energy very well despite their size, being able to go without food for months; they likely outlasted the months-long winter 
	without too much difficulty. Insects like cockroaches and ants were easily able to hide underground, and obviously needed 
	very little food compared to the bigger animals. Additionally, they likely already had plenty of food in the form of the 
	fungi that proliferated from feeding off the dead trees. And a few snake species had both traits, being able to squeeze 
	into safe underground spaces, as well as survive without food for up to a year.
	</p>
	
	<p>Despite an estimated 90% of all mammals dying due to the loss of their forest habitat from fires, mammals as a whole were 
	very well prepared for the extinction event. Their small sizes meant they didn't need to eat much, their nocturnal natures 
	meant they were prepared for the months-long darkness, and their fur likely helped keep them warm. Some of them were burrowers 
	who were able to take cover from the impact underground, and some of them were capable of eating the seeds that trees left 
	behind. Best of all, there were still plenty of insects for them to eat, allowing the few mammals who did survive to do well. 
	Once the winter ended, they (along with avian dinosaurs, i.e. birds) were able to adaptively radiate and fill the open 
	terrestrial niches left by the dead dinosaurs. They were finally able to grow in size and become active during the daytime, 
	since they no longer needed to fear being eaten or outcompeted by larger and better adapted predators (dinosaurs), 
	leading to them attaining their modern prominence.

	<p>Though the asteroid was only around the size of a Ferris wheel, the force of its explosion gave it an impact zone 
	around the size of Taiwan.
