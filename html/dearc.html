	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Dearc sgiathanach</h1>
	
	<p>First of all, the pterosaur's name is pronounced "jark ski-an-ach" because it's a Gaelic name (meaning "winged reptile"), 
	because the pterosaur was discovered in Scotland. It was only discovered in 2022, but was the biggest pterosaur in the Jurassic, 
	as well as the biggest pterosaur that existed before the Cretaceous (which is when pterosaurs started evolving into huge sizes). 
	The Dearc ate aquatic animals, using its jagged teeth to capture slippery prey, including fish and squid (and like any 
	carnivorous dinosaur, it likely wasn't above occasionally scavenging and eating dead things). As a result, it was an aquatic 
	pterosaur rather than a terrestrial one.
	</p>
	
	<p>Its portrayal in the game should be more scientifically accurate than not, aside from the aggressively attacking humans on 
	sight part. It also probably would've hunted for food in the ocean instead of roaming the forests, but then the plot wouldn't be 
	very interesting. Hiding was the most correct option because the Dearc wasn't adapted for hunting in tree-filled forests; 
	it was an aquatic predator (fighting probably would've worked for the same reason, as it evolved to chase its prey, 
	not fight with them). And though there's no way of knowing if it really divebombed like a hawk, its fast speed is probably 
	accurate, as it was similar in size and wingspan to an albatross, which can fly around 50 mph.
