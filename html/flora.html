	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Plants</h1>
	
	<p>During the Jurassic period, gymnosperms (plants who house their seeds in cones, such as pine cones) were the dominant type of plant,
	as angiosperms (flower and fruit producing plants) wouldn't evolve until the Cretaceous period, right after the Jurassic ended. 
	Although angiosperms are more efficient at spreading their seeds around (hence their dominance today), gymnosperms were 
	better adapted to the Jurassic's environment. Their cones protected their seeds from the heat and dryness, and they didn't rely 
	on pollinators like angiosperms do, which was good because birds and bees (two major pollinators) hadn't evolved yet.</p>
	
	
	<p>As a result, angiosperms like grass and flowers were completely absent from the entirety of the Jurassic period, 
	and gymnosperms were abundant. Two kinds of gymnosperms are conifers and cycads, both of which still exist today.
	Conifers are a type of tree that are mostly evergreen and often very tall, with redwoods (the tallest tree species in the world) 
	being a type of conifer. Cycads are a type of evergreen plant that vary in height but resemble shorter and stouter palm trees, 
	though the shorter ones can easily be mistaken for ferns. They were the main forms of plant life during the Jurassic, 
	in addition to gingko trees (also gymnosperms) and ferns (which are seedless and reproduce via spores).</p>
