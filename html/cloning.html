	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Cloning</h1>
	
	<p>Actually, dinosaur cloning is (unsurprisingly) scientifically impossible. Cloning requires intact DNA, and animal DNA 
	fully decays after ~7 million years; dinosaurs went extinct tens of millions of years ago. Even if partially intact DNA was 
	discovered, animals' genetic codes are made of billions of nucleotides. If it was even 95% intact, it'd still be missing 
	millions of nucleotides, with no way to know the correct sequence; just guessing it could take years. The worst part is, 
	even if a successful clone was produced, it'd probably die from all the germs in the atmosphere. Since dinosaurs lived in 
	a completely different environment from today, they would be unlikely to have any immunities or resistances to modern diseases, 
	and would likely die similar to how indigenous peoples died when Europeans brought over smallpox and measles. 
	Either way, in real life, dinosaurs definitely couldn't be brought back within only 7 years, 
	no matter how much money was thrown at the project.
