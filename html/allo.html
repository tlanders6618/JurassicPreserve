	<h1>Jurassic Fun Facts: Allosaurus</h1>
	
	<p>Allosauruses were the closest thing the Jurassic had to a Tyrannosaurus rex. They were among the largest (and most common) 
	carnivores, weighing over 3000 pounds, and were apex predators. They primarily ate other dinosaurs, and were even uniquely capable 
	of killing sauropods (the biggest dinosaurs in existence) if they were small or weak enough. Like other carnivorous dinosaurs, 
	they were opportunistic and perfectly willing to scavenge and eat carrion, free food. It's even possible that they ate each other, 
	either adults eating babies they came across, or adults eating other adults when food was scarce and there were no other options.
	</p>
	
	<p>Their teeth were built like serrated knives, and were often lost during their constant feeding and rapidly regrown, 
	kind of similar to a shark. It's unknown if allosauruses hunted alone or in packs, but it's possible that they might have done 
	both, opportunistically. It's also unclear whether they were pursuit predators or ambush predators, though it's possible they 
	might have opportunistically used both predation techniques. Also, it should be noted that running from an allosaurus would never 
	work in real life because they could run up to 20 miles per hour. A human encounter with them would realistically end with death.
